Tracking our first git pproject
    first check if the folder we are in is a git repository or not for that we can use the command (git status)
    if it is not a git repository then make it a git repository for that use command (git init)
    and now if we run git status command we can see it has become a git repository
    now we can use (git add --a )command to add all files to the staging area 
    after that use (git commit -m "your massage") to commit the changes
    we can use (git log )command to see previous commit

    
    # if you want to stage only one file use (git add fileName.excetention)
